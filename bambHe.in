$ bambHe input file
$ Comments can be added by starting the line with a dollar sign


$ (Input 1) File name containing time and temperature history to be used

stepheat_hist.dat


$ (Input 2) The number of timesteps wanted (nt). The program will read in
$ the thermal history and linearly interpolate the values onto (nt) uniformly
$ spaced timesteps

20

$ (Input 3-1) Flag for diffusion kinetics (D0 and Ea)
$ 1=Farley,2000
$ 2=User specified diffusivity and activation energy use D0 in m2/s, Ea in J/mol.

1


$ (Input 3-2) If custom user specified diffusivity and
$ activation energy is specified then list D0 and Ea below
$ D0:
1.0

$ Ea:
1.0

$ (Input 4) Option for alpha ejection
$ 1=Uses alpha ejection (turned on)
$ 0=Alpha ejection turned off

0

$ (Input 5) Flag for diffusion
$ 0=No diffusion. The concentrations are a product of production rate and time
$ 1=Diffusion. Program runs normally with finite element solution.
$ Note: If the thermal history uses subzero temperatures, then the no diffusion
$ option is most likely wanted

1

$ (Input 5-1) Numerical stability variable: Minimum scaled diffusivity value for 
$ diffusion to occur. The scaled diffusivity is calcuated by:
$ D_scaled = (D_unscaled * maximum_simulation_time) / radius^2 [unitless]
$ All diffusivities evaluted below this threshold will shut off diffusion to maintain
$ numreical stability andcause the concentrations
$ to be calculated as a product of production rate and time.
$ If diffusion flag above is set to 0, this value is disregarded but there
$ still needs to be a value below.
$ Recommended values to use are ~1.0e-3 (or maybe slightly smaller).

1.0e-3


$ NOTE:  Source term (U, Th) are set to a fixed value in the code.  Units don't need to be tracked for this.
$ Similarly, the predicted concentration units are based on the Ea units.

$ ******************************************************************
$ NOTE:  This ends most user input.  Remaining input below only
$ needs to be changed if (a) you change the mesh used with the matlab
$ mesh generation programs, and/or (b) you want change the initial He

1e10

$ (Input 6-3) Radius of sphere in meters for calculating the
$ Ft correction.  Note - changing this number does not change 
$ the radius of the sphere, it only changes the distance over
$ which alpha ejection is calculated.
